    <p>VigLink’s Core Products
        So now that  you’ve cracked your knuckles, copied the VigLink JavaScript, and pasted it into your website’s template…what’s next?  The good news is VigLink starts working without additional effort on your part: you don’t need to retrieve and include affiliate links when you post, or go back and edit old posts to include affiliate links, if you’ve installed the JavaScript. Below you’ll find a rundown of our three main products—Convert, Insert, and Anywhere—to give you a clearer understanding of their capabilities.

        VigLink Convert takes your unaffiliated merchant links* and automatically affiliates them on the click. Did you write a post on your blog in 2008 linking out to 2008 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz on Amazon? Don’t worry about it: VigLink Convert will see that Amazon link and turn it into an affiliate link. That’s it!
        VigLink Insert scans your site for common product terms or merchant mentions and adds an affiliate link. A user on your tech forum may have mentioned how much she loves her iPhone 6, but didn’t hyperlink the term. Your other users might be persuaded to buy an iPhone—and VigLink Insert wants to help you capture that purchase intent by automatically adding an affiliate link to a merchant selling iPhones.
        VigLink Anywhere is your solution if you can’t install the VigLink JavaScript to take advantage of Convert and Insert. Started a Facebook group dedicated to pet merchandise? Grab your PetSmart link to those travel-friendly pet bowls you love. Navigate to the Anywhere tab on your Dashboard > Create a Link and paste the URL into the box where it says “Enter a URL.” You’ll return a link wrapped in VigLink redirects. Now you have a portable link (and your readers can purchase some portable pet bowls!).
